Maria is expanding her business, and today, she is opening a grocery shop. You are hired to write a program that keeps
track of the shop's inventory.

In the product.py file, the class Product should be implemented. It is a base class for any type of food and drink.
The class should receive name: str, and quantity: int upon initialization. It should also have 3 additional methods:
•	decrease(quantity: int) - decreases the quantity of the product only if there is enough
•	increase(quantity: int) - increases the quantity of the product
•	__repr__() - override the method, so it returns the name of the product
In the file drink.py, the class Drink should be implemented. The class should inherit from the Product class. An
instance of the Drink class will have a name and a quantity of 10.
In the food.py file, the Food class should be implemented. The class should inherit from the Product class. An instance
 of the Food class will have a name and a quantity of 15.
In the product_repository.py file, the class ProductRepository should be implemented. It is a repository for all
products that are delivered to the grocery shop.
The class should have products: list - an empty list, which will be containing all products (objects). Also, the class
should have 4 additional methods:
•	add(product: Product) - adds a product to the repository
•	find(product_name: str) - returns a product (object) with that name
•	remove(product_name) - removes a product from the repository
•	__repr__() - override the method, so it returns information for all products in the repository:
"{product_name1}: {quantity1}"
{product_name2}: {quantity2}
…
{product_nameN}: {quantityN}"
