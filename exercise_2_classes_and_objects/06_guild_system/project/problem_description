    You are tasked to create two classes: a Player class and a Guild class.

    The Player class should receive a name (string), a hp (int), and a mp (int) upon initialization. The Player also
    has 2 instance attributes: skills (empty dictionary that will contain the skills of each player and its mana cost)
    and a guild set to "Unaffiliated" by default.
    The Player class should also have two additional methods:
    -	add_skill(skill_name, mana_cost)
        o	Adds the skill and the corresponding mana cost to the dictionary of skills. Returns
            "Skill {skill_name} added to the collection of the player {player_name}"
        o	If the skill is already in the collection, returns "Skill already added"
    -	player_info()
        o	Returns the player's information, including their skills, in this format:
            "Name: {player_name}
             Guild: {guild_name}
             HP: {hp}
             MP: {mp}
             ==={skill_name_1} - {skill_mana_cost}
             ==={skill_name_2} - {skill_mana_cost}
             …
             ==={skill_name_N} - {skill_mana_cost}"

    The Guild class receives a name (string). The Guild should also have one instance attribute players (an empty list
    which will contain the players of the guild). The class also has 3 additional methods:
    -	assign_player(player: Player)
        o	Adds the player to the guild and returns "Welcome player {player_name} to the guild {guild_name}". Remember
            to change the player's guild in the player class.
        o	If he is already in the guild, returns "Player {player_name} is already in the guild."
        o	If the player is in another guild, returns "Player {player_name} is in another guild."
    -	kick_player(player_name: str)
        o	Removes the player from the guild and returns "Player {player_name} has been removed from the guild.". Remember to change the player's guild in the player class to "Unaffiliated".
        o	If there is no such player in the guild, returns "Player {player_name} is not in the guild."
    -	guild_info()
        o	Returns the guild's information, including the players in the guild, in the format:
            "Guild: {guild_name}
            {first_player's info}
            …
            {Nplayer's info}"
