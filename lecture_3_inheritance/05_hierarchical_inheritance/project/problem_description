    In a folder called project create three files: animal.py, dog.py, and cat.py.
    In each file, create its corresponding class - Animal, Dog, and Cat:
    •	Animal with a single method eat() that returns: "eating..."
    •	Dog with a single method bark() that returns: "barking..."
    •	Cat with a single method meow() that returns: "meowing..."
    Both Dog and Cat should inherit from Animal.
