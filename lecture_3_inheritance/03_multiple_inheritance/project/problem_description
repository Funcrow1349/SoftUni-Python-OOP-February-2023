    In a folder called project create three files: person.py, employee.py, and teacher.py.
    In each file, create its corresponding class - Person, Employee, and Teacher:
    •	Person with a single method sleep() that returns: "sleeping..."
    •	Employee with a single method get_fired() that returns: "fired..."
    •	Teacher with a single method teach() that returns: "teaching...".
    Teacher should inherit from Person and Employee.
